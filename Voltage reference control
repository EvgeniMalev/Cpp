#include <Arduino.h>

int potentiometer_pin = A0;
int pwm_pin1 = 3;  
int pwm_pin2 = 4;  
int voltagereference_pin = A1;  

void setup() {
  pinMode(voltagereference_pin, INPUT);
  pinMode(pwm_pin1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pwm_pin2, OUTPUT);

  // Set the PWM frequency for pins 3 and 4
  TCCR2B = TCCR2B & B11111000 | B00000011;
}

void loop() {
  int duty_cycle = analogRead(potentiometer_pin);

  // Map the duty cycle from the potentiometer to a range of 0-254 (8-bit PWM)
  int duty_cycle_mapped = map(duty_cycle, 0, 1023, 0, 254);

  // Apply the duty cycle to both PWM pins
  analogWrite(pwm_pin1, duty_cycle_mapped);
  analogWrite(pwm_pin2, duty_cycle_mapped);
}
Here are the changes and explanations:

Defined pwm_pin1 and pwm_pin2 to specify which pins you are using for PWM.

Defined voltagereference_pin for the voltage reference pin (you need to specify the pin number correctly).

Adjusted the map function to map from 0-1023 (the range of analogRead on Arduino) to 0-254 (as you're using an 8-bit PWM, which has a range of 0-255).

Corrected the comments for pin assignments.

Please make sure to double-check that you're using the correct pin numbers and that they correspond to the physical pins on your Arduino board.
